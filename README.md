Task 1: Walmart Sales Forecasting 
Internship: Machine Learning at Future Interns

CIN: FIT/FEB26/ML5800
Track: ML

    Project Summary
In this task, I predicted Walmart sales trends using historical data. I fixed data errors, cleaned the prices, and built a model to show how sales change over time.

     What I Did:
Cleaned Data: Removed the $ from prices and fixed missing values so the code wouldn't crash.
Fixed Dates: Set the correct date format to stop Python warnings.
Feature Engineering: Created "Month" and "Day" columns to help the AI learn seasonal patterns.
Visualization: Created a "Daily Sales Trend" graph to show results clearly.
